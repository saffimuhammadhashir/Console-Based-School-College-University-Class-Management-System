Title: Console-Based Classroom Management System in C++

Introduction:
Welcome to the Console-Based Classroom Management System, a comprehensive and efficient project developed by Alex. This system replicates the functionalities of popular virtual classroom platforms like Google Classroom using the power of C++ programming language and advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

Key Features:

1. **User Management:** Our system employs OOP principles, including inheritance and polymorphism, to seamlessly manage different user roles such as teachers and students. Password encryption and validation enhance security, while file handling ensures persistent user data storage.

2. **Class Management:** Create, organize, and maintain virtual classrooms effortlessly. Through aggregation and composition, our system manages associations between classes and users, allowing easy class creation, updates, deletions, and roster management.

3. **Assignment Management:** Handle assignments seamlessly with encapsulation and abstraction. Create, update, and delete assignments while preventing past deadline creations. File handling techniques store assignment data efficiently, including details and attached files.

4. **Submission and Grading:** Students can submit assignments, and teachers can review and grade them. Different submission types are supported through inheritance and polymorphism. Validation prevents late submissions, and file handling techniques manage submission and grading data.

5. **Gradebook:** Monitor student progress and class averages with ease. The gradebook class calculates and updates grades based on assignment scores and weightage. Generate comprehensive grade reports for individuals or the entire class.

6. **File Management:** Manage files related to classes, assignments, and submissions seamlessly. Our file manager class handles upload, download, and deletion operations while enforcing file size limits and appropriate formats.

7. **Notification System:** Stay updated with important deadlines and announcements. Customizable notifications inform users about new assignments, upcoming deadlines, and graded submissions. File handling stores notification data efficiently.

8. **User Interface:** Enjoy a user-friendly console-based interface with menus, prompts, and dialogues for easy navigation. Encapsulation and abstraction ensure a modular and intuitive user experience.

9. **Data Persistence:** Our robust file handling techniques ensure data longevity and reliability. User profiles, class information, assignments, submissions, grades, and notifications are stored in files for seamless data retrieval.

10. **Exception Handling:** The system gracefully manages runtime errors and exceptional conditions, providing meaningful error messages and preventing crashes. Comprehensive exception handling ensures stability and effective troubleshooting.

Conclusion:
Alex's Console-Based Classroom Management System showcases the effective use of C++ programming and OOP concepts to create a user-friendly, efficient, and comprehensive educational tool. With features ranging from user management to grade calculation, this project exemplifies software development best practices and serves as a potential asset for real-world classroom management needs. Join us in exploring the future enhancements and possibilities of this innovative project.
